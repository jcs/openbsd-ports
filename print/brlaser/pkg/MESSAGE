After installation, configure a printer in the CUPS administration
interface (http://localhost:631 by default).

Choose LPD for the printer type and enter the printer's IP address
and a queue name (possibly "binary_p1") such as:

	lpd://192.168.1.100/binary_p1

After selecting Brother as the manufacturer, you should see
supported printer models listed with "using brlaser".
