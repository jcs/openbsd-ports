CUPS driver for Brother laser printers.

Most Brother printers support a standard printer language such as
PCL or PostScript, but not all do. If you have a monochrome Brother
laser printer (or multi-function device) and the other open source
drivers don't work, this one might help.

It is known to support these printers:

    Brother DCP-7030
    Brother DCP-7055
    Brother DCP-7065DN
