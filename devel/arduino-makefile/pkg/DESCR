This is a very simple Makefile which knows how to build Arduino
sketches. It defines entire workflows for compiling code, flashing
it to Arduino and even communicating through Serial monitor. You
don't need to change anything in the Arduino sketches.

To use, create a Makefile and add:

	include ${PREFIX}/share/arduino-makefile/Arduino.mk

Then compile with `gmake` and upload with `gmake upload`.
