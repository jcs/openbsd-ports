+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This port contains the libraries/headers as well as examples and documentation
needed to start developing with Arduino.

For now it doesn't contain the frontend application yet, instead a Makefile
and various helper scripts are provided.

Typical Usage
=============

* Use ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/arduinoproject to create a new project directory.
* Hack the .ino file.
* `make` will build the project.
* `make upload` flashes the program to your arduino.

Before you can upload your programs, you should review the AVRdude
variables in the Makefile. Different arduino models require different
parameters; pay particular attention to UPLOAD_RATE and
AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER.

If you do not know which parameters you need, take a peek at:
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/arduino/boards.txt

Syntax Highlighting
===================

* vim    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2654
* emacs  https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode
